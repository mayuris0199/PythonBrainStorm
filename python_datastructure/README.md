# Datastructure and Algorithm

###Why we need data structure ?

Data structure solve some execution probles which should handle & process milions & bilions
of data with below thing in mind.

1. The algo should use low cpu cycles.
2. The algo shouild use low memory.
3. The algo should handle parallel requests.
4. The algo should be low I/O operations on disk 
5. The algo should be minimize execution time.

###Algorithm
```
Write algorithm which will handle above 5 things will make your code perfect in all way.
Algorithm is a step by step procedure to be executed in certain order to get required output.
it is designed to achieve optimum solution for given problem.
```

###For below operations we write Algorithms.
```
1. Search
2. Sort
3. Create
4. Read
5. Update
6. Delete
```
# Searching Algorithm
```
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
```
# Sorting Algorithm
```
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Heap Sort
```
# Datastructure Algorithm
```
1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Linked list
```
